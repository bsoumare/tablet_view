        <h2>OMEN!</h2>
        <img src="images/omen.jpeg" alt="omen vs nemo" width="400">
        <p>Omen is Nemo's long lost brother. In the Finding Nemo Movie, it is portrayed that nemo's mother as well as all of his sibling's eggs were devoured and died. However, that is not the case. The truth is that Nemo's mother survived the attack and so did omen. Unfortunately, nemo's mother as well as omen were lost and far from their family, so they lost all hope and decided to settle where they were. They overcame many struggles and managed to meet a new friendly fish family. Omen grew to be similar to nemo, but the main difference is that he was never "found". Eventually, Omen was caught and became a pet. There was a movie created later for Omen called Catching Omen.

        <h2>Milo</h2>
        <img src="images/milo_main.png" alt="Milo sitting on grass" width="400">
        <br>
        <p>Milo is a 6 year old schnoodle. Milo is super energetic and loves to play fetch at literally any time of day. Milo loves all sorts of things, especially 
             humans. Milo can sometimes get jealous of other dogs or attention seeking. At other times he can get distracted with other
             things such as chasing a ball.</p>
        <p>Milo is also a pretty smart dog, although he doesn't always use it for good. He can roll over on command,
            and use his sense of scent to find a hidden treat. But he’s also figured out some loopholes to get what
            he wants. For example, he has been trained to nudge the bell near the front door to indicate that he
            needs to be walked. Recently, though, he’s learned that he can just pretend like he wants to go on a
            walk, but instead lead us around the house to the backyard so he can play. In case it wasn’t clear: Milo
            loves to play. Although he can be sneaky, my family loves him more than anything.</p>

        <br>
        <img src="images/torpedo1.JPG" alt="Torpedo Chilling" width="400">
        <p>Torpedo is a 5(+) year old yellow bellied slider turtle. She loves bathing in the sun and eating shrimp. The Yellow-bellied Slider Turtles are a fascinating species known for their distinctive physical attributes and interesting behavioral tendencies. They are a subspecies of the pond slider turtles, notable for their vibrant yellow undersides or plastrons, hence their name. Yellow-bellied Slider Turtles typically inhabit a wide range of freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, swamps, marshes, and slow-moving rivers across southeastern parts of the United States. They showcase a semi-aquatic lifestyle, spending significant time basking in the sun on warm days. In terms of diet, they follow an omnivorous feeding routine, primarily consuming aquatic plants, insects, fish, and occasionally certain types of fruits and berries. This species plays a valuable role in maintaining ecological stability by controlling certain aquatic plant and insect populations.

        <p>Wrigley is an energetic three year old beagle mix. If he is not on a walk, then he is running laps around the yard. He is very excitable around other people and dogs, which may cause him to start howling, but he is friendly. When not being active, Wrigley will lay by the windows to people watch. He also loves to nap while sun bathing or sleep curled under a blanket on the couch.

She is just as energetic as Wrigley, and despite her smaller size, will best him in a chase. She is a bit of a digger and hunter. Even though she has mischievous tendencies, she is a great listener and responds to commands well. She is able to sit, give paw and fist bump. When Ivy is not outside, she loves receiving cuddles and kisses, however, she will walk away to lay down once she gets her fill. She loves attention and getting toys.
